# AI in Biomemdicine

The aim of this project is to develop an AI model for automatic collection of new traits, which can enable improved farm management and the selection of genetically superior animals. 

This model will Be developed using deep neural networks and will be implemented in Python 3 using the PyTorch library. 
The proposed method will be compared with baselines such as basic search, linear regression, and SVM.

# Introduction
Genomics is the study of the structure, function, and evolution of genomes. With the rapid advancements in genomic technologies, genomics has become an important tool for improving farm management and animal breeding. Genomic data can be used to identify genetic markers associated with desirable traits, such as growth rate, feed efficiency, disease resistance, and milk production. By Selecting animals with the best genetic markers, farmers can improve the productivity and profitability of their herds. 
However, collecting genomic data can be timeconsuming and expensive. Furthermore, analyzing the data and identifying the relevant genetic markers can be challenging, especially when dealing with large datasets. Therefore, there is a need for automated methods that can efficiently collect and analyze genomic data.
