# AI in Biomemdicine

The aim of this project is to develop an AI model for automatic collection of new traits, which can enable improved farm management and the selection of genetically superior animals. 

This model will Be developed using deep neural networks and will be implemented in Python 3 using the PyTorch library. 
The proposed method will be compared with baselines such as basic search, linear regression, and SVM.
